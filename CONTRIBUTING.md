## Code of Conduct
By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold the project's Code of Conduct. Please read the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` before contributing.

## Coding Standards and Style Guide
We want to ensure that the codebase is maintainable, readable, and consistent across all contributions. We follow the [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) for our bash scripts. Please make sure to follow the guide for all contributions.

Here are some additional guidelines to follow:

- Use meaningful variable names and comments to make the code easy to understand.
- Use functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
- Use exit codes appropriately to signal success or failure of commands.
- Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that your code passes our linting and formatting checks. 

    You can run the checks locally by installing shellcheck and running:

    ```
    $ shellcheck your_script.sh
    ```

## Commit Message Style Guide
When contributing to this project, please follow the guidelines below for your commit messages:

- Use the imperative mood in your commit messages (e.g. "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug")
- Keep the first line of your commit message under 50 characters
- Use the body of the commit message to explain what and why you made the changes
- Start the body with a blank line
- Use bullet points to list any important changes or new features
- Use the present tense when describing what the commit does (e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the past tense when describing what the commit did (e.g. "Fixed bug" instead of "Fix bug")
  
Here's an example of a good commit message:

```
- Updated dependency X to version Y
- Added error handling to function Z
```

And here's an example of a bad commit message:

```
Fixed app bug
```

Please take the time to write clear and informative commit messages, as they help everyone understand the changes made to the codebase.
